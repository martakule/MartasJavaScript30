        <p>Every day I’m amazed by how willing the tech community is to share their knowledge and experience. I can’t think of any other industry that not only doesn’t jealously guard its secrets but simply CANNOT wait to tell you how this or that is built. Just imagine you tell a famous chef you liked her signature dish, and she jumps right in, “Oh, let me give you the recipe! Actually, no, let me TEACH you how to make this! For free. I just really want you to be able to cook it yourself! Do you have time right now?”</p>

        <p>Well, this pretty much has been my experience in the tech community. This is why this page exists. <a href="http://wesbos.com/" target="_blank">Wes Bos</a>, a fantastic developer and educator, created a huge free set of instructional videos and exercises so that you and I can practice JavaScript. Just because he really wants you to be able to build things yourself. Thanks, Wes!</p>

        <p>I took him up on the challenge, and here I’m showing off my takes on <a href="https://javascript30.com/" target="_blank">JavaScript 30</a>. I’ve never coded in pure JS before, so this has been a great learning experience &ndash; starting from building that menu in the top left corner without jQuery. ;) Anyway, check out the menu for the list of projects completed to date.

        <p>Enjoy!</p>
